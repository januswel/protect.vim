                                                Last change: 2014 Sep 24.

SYNOPSIS						*protect-synopsis*
>
	" in your .vimrc
	let g:protect_readonly_paths = "~/importants/*"
	let g:protect_nomodifiable_paths = '~/veryimportants/**'

DESCRIPTION						*protect-description*

Plugin to enable 'readonly' or disable 'modifiable' based on the file path
automatically, when you open files.

DEPENDENCIES						*protect-dependencies*

{only available when your VIM has the |+autoload| feature}

PROVIDES						*protect-provides*

Commands:
:ProtectFiles
	Activate your configuration with global variables.  See
	|protect-settings|.

Augroups:
protect
	All of the autocmds provided by this plugin are located in "protect".
	To disable in a certain instance of VIM, hit the following command: >

		:autocmd! protect

SETTINGS						*protect-settings*

DEFAULT

	Following paths are set readonly and nomodifiable.

		* /var/run/**
		* $VIM/**
		* $INCLUDE/**

Variables:
g:protect_readonly_paths
	Paths to execute ":setlocal readonly". A |String|, a |List| or a
	|Dictionary| can be specified.
	With a String, use "," to set more than one value: >

		let g:protect_readonly_paths = '$VIM/**, ~/repos/tags/**'
<
	Use of a List with |line-continuation| is better for readability: >

		let g:protect_readonly_paths = [
		                \    '$VIM/**',
		                \    '/home/mymaster/opened/**',
		                \ ]
<
	With a Dictionary, same as a List but keys are ignored, so it's handy
	to give a comprehensive lable: >

		let g:protec_readonly_paths = {
				\   'VIM distribution': '$VIM/**',
		                \   'Ruby library':     'C:/Ruby/lib/**',
				\ }
<
	Note that when this plugin is sourced and you execute :ProtectFiles,
	the configurations become effective. So restart VIM after defining the
	variable in your .vimrc, or hit :ProtectFiles after changing a value
	of this variable.

g:protect_nomodifiable_paths
	Same as g:protect_readonly_paths but specified paths are covered with
	":setlocal nomodifiable".

DISABLES						*protect-disables*

Variables:
g:loaded_protect
	When exists, does nothing. Use to disable this plugin.
